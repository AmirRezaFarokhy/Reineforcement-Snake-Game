# Reineforcement-Snake-Game
Making snake game and giving its environment inside reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Description of use it
First, you have to run the `model.py` file and you have to leave it for at least 8 hours to train, and then you can load the model by using the models folder that is created, and put its path in `load_model.py`.
